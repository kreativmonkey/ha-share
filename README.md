# Home Assistant Resources

Welcome to my repository of resources for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)!  
Here you’ll find useful blueprints and, in the future, more templates that I personally use and continuously expand.

## Contents

Currently, you’ll find the following automation blueprints:

- **AC Cycle Reduction**  
  Reduces the switching frequency (cycling) of air conditioning units to extend their lifespan and save energy.

- **Simple Cover Control**  
  Controls covers (e.g., blinds or shutters) based on conditions like sun position, time, or presence.

More resources and blueprints will be added over time!

## How to Import Blueprints into Home Assistant

You can use these blueprints in two ways:

1. **Direct Import:**  
   Each blueprint folder contains a file with a direct import link for Home Assistant (usually `import_link.md` or similar).  
   Simply click the link and follow the instructions in Home Assistant.

2. **Manual Import:**  
   Alternatively, download the `blueprint.yaml` file and import it in Home Assistant via  
   **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints → Import Blueprint**.
